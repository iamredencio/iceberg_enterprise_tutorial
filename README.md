## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Choose your platform** from the options above
2. **Download the appropriate notebook** for your environment
3. **Follow the setup instructions** in the first cell of the notebook
4. **Run cells sequentially** - each notebook is self-contained

## üîß Why Separate Versions?

The original cross-platform notebook was experiencing conflicts due to:
- Different Java installation paths across platforms
- Package dependency conflicts between environments
- Memory and resource constraints varying by platform
- Platform-specific optimization opportunities

Each version now provides:
- ‚úÖ **Zero conflicts** - platform-specific setup
- ‚úÖ **Optimized performance** - tuned for each environment
- ‚úÖ **Clear instructions** - no guesswork
- ‚úÖ **Reliable execution** - tested configurations

## üìä Dataset Comparison

| Platform | Sites | Time Chunks | Technologies | Vendors | Focus |
|----------|-------|-------------|--------------|---------|-------|
| macOS    | 100   | 50          | 6G, 7G       | 3       | Development |
| Colab    | 50    | 20          | 6G, 7G       | 3       | Learning |
| Linux    | 200   | 100         | 6G, 7G, 8G   | 4       | Production |

## ü§ù Support

- **macOS issues**: Check Java installation with `brew list openjdk`
- **Colab issues**: Try "Runtime" ‚Üí "Restart runtime" if packages conflict
- **Linux issues**: Verify Java with `java -version` and check distribution-specific commands
